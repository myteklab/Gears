# Gears

An interactive gear simulation where you can design and animate mechanical gear systems.

## Features

- **Drag & Drop Gears**: Add gears of various sizes (8 to 32 teeth) to the canvas
- **Automatic Meshing**: Gears snap together and automatically calculate gear ratios
- **Driver Gear System**: Set any gear as the "driver" that powers the entire system
- **Real-time Animation**: Watch your gear train spin with accurate physics
- **Kinematic Conflict Detection**: System locks up if gears create impossible configurations
- **Outputs**: Attach fans, clocks, and spinners to gears to visualize rotation
- **Customization**: Adjust gear colors, tooth thickness, and background

## Educational Value

Gears teaches fundamental concepts in mechanical engineering and mathematics:

- **Gear Ratios**: Larger gears spin slower, smaller gears spin faster
- **Speed Calculations**: RPM is inversely proportional to gear size
- **Direction**: Meshed gears rotate in opposite directions
- **Torque**: Trade-offs between speed and power
- **System Constraints**: Why some gear configurations are mechanically impossible

## Controls

- **Drag gears** from the palette onto the canvas
- **Click a gear** to select it and view properties
- **Right-click** for context menu
- **Scroll** to zoom in/out
- **Middle-click drag** to pan

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+S` - Save project
- `Delete` - Remove selected gear
- `Space` - Toggle play/pause
